# Joplin Explorer

Copy snippets of code from joplin to your clipboard.

### Commands

Type n and the name of a note to search for. Choose it and it will be copied to
your clipboard.

If a note has code all the code will be copied to the clipboard without the markup tags. 

You can also have a subsearch for a json code block if you have a code block that is marked with
`json search` instead of simply 'json'. This way each key of the json code
block will become searchable.

### Configuration

* You must configure a API token for joplin that you cant get on the desktop app's Option -> Web Clipper.

* Notebook to search (Default is snippet) which is optional.
